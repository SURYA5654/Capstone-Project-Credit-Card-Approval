# Capstone-Project-Credit-Card-Approval
Project proposal to predict credit card approval

# Utilize machine learning approaches to predict credit card approval based on customer information.

A bank's credit card department is one of the top adopters of data science. A top focus for the bank has always been acquiring new credit card customers. Giving out credit cards without doing proper research or evaluating applicants' creditworthiness is quite risky. The credit card department has been using a data-driven system for credit assessment called Credit Scoring for many years, and the model is known as an application scorecard. A credit card application's cutoff value is determined using the application scorecard, which also aids in estimating the applicant's level of risk. This decision is made based on strategic priority at a given time.

Customers must fill out a form, either physically or online, to apply for a credit card. The application data is used to evaluate the applicant's creditworthiness. The decision is made using the application data in addition to the Credit Bureau Score, such as the FICO Score in the US or the CIBIL Score in India, and other internal information on the applicants. Additionally, the banks are rapidly taking a lot of outside data into account to enhance the caliber of credit judgements.
